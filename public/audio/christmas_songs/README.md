# Christmas Songs Audio Files

This directory should contain instrumental audio snippets (5-10 seconds each) for the "Guess the Christmas Song" mini-game.

## File Naming Convention

Files should be named according to the `audioSrc` paths in `content/guess_the_song_christmas.ts`:

- `/audio/christmas_songs/jingle_bells_01.mp3`
- `/audio/christmas_songs/silent_night_01.mp3`
- `/audio/christmas_songs/deck_the_halls_01.mp3`
- etc.

## Audio Requirements

- **Format**: MP3 or OGG (preferred for web)
- **Length**: 5-10 seconds
- **Type**: Instrumental snippets (no vocals)
- **Volume**: Subtle, non-intrusive
- **Quality**: Clear and recognizable

## Adding Audio Files

1. Obtain instrumental versions of Christmas songs
2. Extract 5-10 second snippets from recognizable parts
3. Name files according to the pattern above
4. Place files in this directory

Note: The game will work without audio files, but players won't hear the snippets. The TV will show a music note icon and a replay button.
